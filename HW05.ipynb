    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher's popular experiment with tea tasting served as the impetus for the investigation. The purpose of this exercise was to ascertain whether or not the students in STA130 were able to differentiate between the sequence in which milk or tea was poured. The experiment was conducted with a total of eighty students, and out of them, forty-nine individuals were able to accurately identify the sequence in which the pouring was performed. A statistical hypothesis test was carried out in order to determine whether or not the outcomes could be ascribed to a random guessing process or whether or not the students really displayed an ability to differentiate between the two sets of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypthothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheses for the experiment were stated as follows:\n",
    "- For the purpose of the null hypothesis (H_0), it was assumed that the students were making guesses at random, and the likelihood of making an accurate identification was calculated to be 0.5.\n",
    "- For the alternative hypothesis (H_A), it was postulated that the students had the capacity to differentiate between the order in which they poured, which led to a probability of p greater than 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a summary of the data that was collected:\n",
    "- There were 80 students included in the sample size (n).\n",
    "- The total number of responses that were found to be accurate (x) was recorded as 49.\n",
    "The estimated value for the observed percentage (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) turns out to be \\(49 / 80 = 0.6125\\), which is equivalent to 61.25%.\n",
    "\n",
    "A binomial test with one tail was carried out in order to determine the validity of the hypotheses. The purpose of selecting this test was to determine if the observed success rate (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) was considerably higher than the predicted success rate, which was based on the null hypothesis (\\(p_0 = 0.5\\)). Following the calculation of the test statistic, the p-value was obtained in order to ascertain the degree of evidence that is contrary to the null hypothesis (H_0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the findings that resulted from the analysis:\n",
    "- The estimated value for the observed percentage (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) was 0.6125, which is equivalent to 61.25%.\n",
    "- The p-value was 0.0283, which is equivalent to about 2.83% of the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the interpretation of the data, the null hypothesis (H_0) was rejected. \n",
    "- This was due to the fact that the p-value (0.0283) was lower than the significance threshold (\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)).\n",
    "-Â Based on the data, it seems that the students did not make their guesses at random and may have some capacity to differentiate between the different pouring orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The results were interpreted as follows:\n",
    "- Due to the observation that the p-value (0.0283) was lower than the significance level (\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)), the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) was rejected.\n",
    "- Based on the data, it seems that the students did not make their guesses at random and may have some capacity to differentiate between the different pouring orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, it emerged that the success rate that was observed, which was 61.25%, was much greater than the assumption of 50% that was made based on random guessing. It was determined that the alternative hypothesis, which stated that the students displayed an actual capacity to discern between the sequence in which they poured milk and tea, was more likely to be correct than the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "By demonstrating the significance of hypothesis testing in the process of evaluating claims about human capability and sensory distinction, this investigation established its value. Despite the fact that the findings revealed statistical significance, it is possible that the students' performance was impacted by an extra set of variables, such as previous experience or external circumstances. Experiments that are conducted in the future might make use of bigger sample numbers, randomized circumstances, or controlled factors in order to bolster the results and give more insights on the capability of distinguishing the pouring order.\n",
